(200 words summary of the design study your team proposed)

# Report

# This section is the in-class assignment to pick a topic and outline steps for analysis
## Topic: Cars
## Group: Brian McKean, Ming Liew, Karen Blakemore, Matt Schroder
 Steps
 - Collect
 - Decompile
 - Extract
 - Stats
 - Diff

 For examining the subject of cars we chose to look at
 - 1) Model with the most sales
 - 2) Average Selling Price of Models

 We then will get data to see if auto characteristics are
 related to these two factors
 - Collect: Use a web sites like: Edmunds.com, kbb.com, consumerreports.org, http://www.nhtsa.gov/
 - Decompile: Data probably does not need to decompiled
 - Extract: Extract from dat the information we're looking for
 - Stats: In addition to Units sold by year, make and model and Average Sale price
We look for: HP, Engine Type, Color, Fuel, Body Style, MPG, Drive Train, transmission type, number of passengers, saftey ratings, reliability (also look at web sites for other tyoes of information like availability of certin options like lether seats, sunroof, etc.)
 - Diff: Look for difference by make, model & year for stats to see if
there are correlations to units sold or average sales price

Not sure what tools are available for correlation analysis.
We could divide the metrics we are looking for into a hsitogram and then map the typical car characteristics into each bucket of the histogram to see as we go from smallest units sold to most units sold etc. what the configuration of the cars were.
